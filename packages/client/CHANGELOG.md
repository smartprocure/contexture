* Removed allowBlank.
* Allowing types to have init functions that can extend each node.
* Added an optional onChange function that gets called as soon as the extend function gets excecuted. It gets called with the node's path, the node and the changes received.
* Removed defaultHasValue and added a validate function to each of the example types.

### Migration Guide
Replace every call like this: `ContextTree(tree, service, types, {...config})`
with a call like this: `ContextTree({service, types, ...config}, tree)`

# 1.3.0

* Made mutate a first class dispatchable event to avoid multiple dispatches
* Separated `defaultTypes` out to `exampleTypes.js`

# 1.1.0

## Major internal overhaul

**Note** Since the public API did not change, this is not a major version release - but these changes should result in _substantially_ improved performance.

A big theme was realizing that the edge case of async validation messing up in-progress dispatches is not actually possible in JS since it is single threaded - and even if it was, we don't snapshot the actual data/config values anyway.

* Removed almost all internal snapshotting (except serialization) by ignoring non-existant race conditions
* Validation now runs only 1 time per dispatch and stamps on group nodes (simplifying the API)
* All reactor processing and search blocking is now synchronous and have had their APIs radically simplified
* Removed all explicit knowledge of path encoding, instead using a single function
* Removed tons of custom code in favor of generic flat tree methods (originally extracted from this repo)
* Paths are no longer stamped on nodes (side effect of using a more generic method)
* Encoded path delimiter changed from `->` to `/`

# 1.0.5

* flattenTree fix for nodes that already have a path.

# 1.0.4

* package.json description and formatting thanks to Duti.

# 1.0.3

* Added babel-plugin-transform-runtime.
