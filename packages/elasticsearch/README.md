Elasticsearch Provider for Contexture

## Usage
This provider takes a config object as a parameter, and expects a `getClient` method to be provided, which should be an instantiated elasticsearch client.

### Provider
This provider takes a config object as a parameter:

| Option      | Type       | Description                                      | Required |
| ------      | ----       | -----------                                      | -------- |
| `getClient` | `function` | Returns an instantiated elasticsearch client     | x        |
| `types`     | `object`   | Contexture node types, like all other providers  |          |

### Schemas
Schemas with with an elasticsearch provider can specify any or all of the following properties:

| Option         | Type       | Description                          | Required |
| ------         | ----       | -----------                          | -------- |
| `index`        | `string`   | Which ES index to use when querying  | x        |
| `highlight`    | `object`   | Used by `results` to determine what fields to highlight, and whether or not they are `inline` (copied over inline on to the source) or `additional` (in a list of additional fields that matched) | |

### Example Schema for SomeType in SomeIndex

```js
module.exports = {
  elasticsearch: {
    index: 'SomeIndex'
  }
}
```

### Seting up contexture
```js
let _ = require('lodash/fp')
let Contexture = require('contexture')
let provider = require('contexture-elasticsearch')
let types = require('contexture-elasticsearch/types')
let schemas = require('./path/to/schemas')
let elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch')
let AgentKeepAlive  = require('agentkeepalive'),

// Setup
let process = Contexture({
  schemas,
  providers: {
    elasticsearch: provider({
      getClient: _.memoize(() =>
        elasticsearch.Client({
          // This is an example config, see the elasticsearch js docs for more
          minSockets: 1,
          maxSockets: 20,
          keepAlive: true,
          createNodeAgent: (connection, config) =>
            new AgentKeepAlive(connection.makeAgentConfig(config))
        })
      ),
      types: types({
        geo: {
          geocodeLocation: query =>
            googleplaces.textSearch({
              query
            })
        }
      })
    })
  }
})

// Simple usage (tree would come from the client)
process(tree)

// Usage with custom headers applied to every elasticsearch request (tree would come from the client)
process(tree, {
  requestOptions: {
    headers: {
      'custom-header-app-name': 'my-app-sent-this'
    }
  },  
})
```

## Automatic Schema Detection
As of 0.10.0, a `getSchemas` async method is exposed on an instantiated provider, which will read the elasticsearch mappings and aliases to automatically generate schemas.

Generated schemas also include field definitions, which can leveraged with something like `exampleTypeSchemaMapping` to make them fit for consumption by dynamic field pickers such as the one in contexture-react.

## Default Types

### Combo Filter + Result Types
These types both filter and have contextual results.

#### `facet`
Facet represents a list of dynamic choices, e.g. a checkbox list filter.

Input

| Name            | Type                            | Default           | Description |
| ----            | ----                            | -------           | ----------- |
| `field`         | string                          | None, *required*  | The field it's operating on |
| `mode`          | `include`/`exclude`             | include           | Should this filter act as inclusion or exclusion of the values |
| `values`        | array[string]                   | []                | What is checked |
| `fieldMode`     | `autocomplete`/`word`/`suggest` | autocomplete      | Whether to look at the entire field (autocomplete), the analyzed words in the field, or magic suggestions. This generally means switching field/analyzers but abstracts that lower level es/index knowledge away from the client. |
| `size`          | number                          | 12                | How many options to return |
| `cardinality`   | number                          | 5000              | Precision threshold override |
| `includeZeroes` | boolean                         | false             | If true, it will include options with 0 matching documents (aka `min_doc_count: 0`) |
| `optionsFilter` | string                          | ''                | Filters the options further, e.g. a find box above a checkbox list |
| `caseSensitive` | boolean                         | false             | Whether options filter is case sensitive. *no known usages* |
| `sort`          | `term`/`count`                  | count             | Sort results alphabetically or by count of matching records |


Output

```js
{
  cardinality: Number, // Cardinality (total number of options) for the field
  options: [{
    name: String,
    count: Number
  }]
}
```

#### `geo`
Represents a geographic radius search. Needs a geocodeLocation service passed in to it. Currently assumes it is a HERE maps geocoder search.

Input

| Name            | Type                            | Default           | Description |
| ----            | ----                            | -------           | ----------- |
| `field`         | string                          | None, *required*  | The field it's operating on |
| `location`      | string                          | None, *required*  | Location to geocode (e.g. an address, businessname, anything the google geocode can take) |
| `radius`        | number                          | None, *required*  | Radius in miles |
| `operator`      | `within`/`not within`           | within            | Whether the filter forces inclusion or exclusion |

Output

```js
{
  Latitude: Number
  Longitude: Number
}
```

The result can be used to show what location the server on a map, though in practice it's usually better to geocode on the client. This type is planned to be extended to support passing along raw lat/lng.


### Filter Only Types
Filter only types just filter and nothing more. They don't have contextual results of their own.


#### `bool`
Bool represent a boolean check, e.g. a checkbox for true/false

```js
{
  field: String,
  value: String|Boolean
}
```

#### `date`
Date represents a data range filter, with support datemath

```js
{
  field: String,
  from: DateString|'thisQuarter|lastQuarter|nextQuarter', // Date string or one of three custom date math options
  to: DateString,
  useDateMath: Boolean, // If true, it will parse dates as dateMath using @elastic/datemath
  isDateTime: Boolean // If true, it will pass the from and to values as is, without formatting assuming it is valid date & time ES string
}
```

#### `exists`
Exists represents whether or not a field is present on results

```js
{
  field: String,
  value: Boolean // Whether the field should exist or not
}
```

#### `number`
Number represents a number range with inclusive bounds. This type provides the ability to determine the best range values based on percentile interval and range threshold.

Some Notes:
1. An empty value as the upper boundary represents infinity.
2. An empty value as the lower boundary represents negative infinity.
3. Zero has to be respected as a boundary value.
4. If findBestRange is true it will return the best min and max range.

Request:

```js
{
  field: String,
  min: Number,
  max: Number,
  percentileInterval: Number,
  rangeThreshold: Number,
  findBestRange = Boolean
}
```

Response:

```js
{
  statistical: {
    count: Number,
    min: Number,
    max: Number,
    avg: Number,
    sum: Number
  },
  percentiles: {
    rangeMin: Number,
    rangeMax: Number,
    intervalMin: Number,
    intervalMax: Number
  },
  bestRange: {
    min: Number,
    max: Number
  }
}
```
#### `numberRangeHistogram`
Number represents a number range with inclusive bounds. This type returns feedback in the form of histogram and statistical data.

Some Notes:
1. An empty value as the upper boundary represents infinity.
2. An empty value as the lower boundary represents negative infinity.
3. Zero has to be respected as a boundary value.

```js
{
  field: String,
  min: Number,
  max: Number,
  percentileInterval: Number
}
```

#### `query`
Query represents a raw elasticsearch query_string.
```js
{
  field: String,
  query: String, // The actual query
  exact: Boolean // Represents opting out of stemming. Currently assumes the presence of an `.exact` subfield and analyzer. Defaults to false.
}

```

#### `tagsQuery`
Tags represents one or more search terms.
```js
{
  field: String,
  tags: [
          {
            word: String, // Search term
            misspellings: Boolean (optional), // Valid for single word search term
            isPhrase: Boolean (optional), // Valid for multi-word search term
            distance: Number (optional) // Valid for multi-word search term
          }
        ], // One or more objects
  join: 'any|all|none', // One of these options
  exact: Boolean // Represents opting out of stemming. Currently assumes the presence of an `.exact` subfield and analyzer. Defaults to false.
}
```

#### `text`
Text implements raw text analysis like starts with, ends with, etc. These are generally regex queries.



### Result-Only Types
These types don't do any filtering of their own and only have results. These often power charts or analytics pages.

#### `cardinality`
A cardinality aggregation. Returns the cardinality of a field.

Input

| Name            | Type                            | Default           | Description |
| ----            | ----                            | -------           | ----------- |
| `field`         | string                          | None, *required*  | The field it's operating on |
| `fieldMode`     | `autocomplete`/`word`/`suggest` | word              | Whether to look at the entire field (autocomplete), the analyzed words in the field, or magic suggestions. This generally means switching field/analyzers but abstracts that lower level es/index knowledge away from the client. |

Output

```
{
  cardinality: {
    cardinality: {
      field: String,
    },
  },
}
```
 

#### `dateHistogram`
A nested stats aggregation inside a dateHistogram aggregation, with support for tweaking min/max bounds.

#### `esTwoLevelAggregation`
An attempt at a generic version of many of these types, which nests two aggregations - generally a metric inside a bucket. 
Supports include to specify specific aggregation types if include is empty it returns all aggregations under stats aggregation.

#### `groupedMetric`
A more general version of esTwoLevelAggregation, used in analysis builders/pivot tables. It takes config for an array of buckets and a metric agg. The buckets are nested with the metric on the inside.

#### `matchCardinality`
A filters bucket which puts results into a pass and fail bucket, along with a cardinality metric nested inside.

#### `matchStats`
A filters bucket which puts results into a pass and fail bucket, along with a stats metric nested inside.

#### `nLevelAggregation`
An infinitely nestable tree of aggs along with some support for a pipeline of specific reducers.

#### `nonzeroClusters`
Starts with a smart interval histogram merges buckets with nonzero counts.

#### `percentileRanks`
An ES percentile_ranks aggregation.

#### `percentiles`
An ES percentiles aggregation.

#### `percentilesRange`
Does a range aggregation based on the result of a percentiles aggregation.

#### `rangeStats`
A stats aggregation in a range aggregation.

#### `results`
Search result "hits", with support for highlighting, paging, sorting, etc.

#### `smartIntervalHistogram`
A stats aggregation inside a histogram aggreation - divided into intelligent chunks based on the min and max and snapping to clean "smart" business friendly intervals (roughly 25% of powers of 10).

#### `smartPercentileRanks`
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

#### `statistical`
A stats aggregation.

#### `terms`
A terms aggregation.

#### `termsDelta`
Shows the difference in terms between a foreground filter and a background filter. Very useful e.g. for showing things like new term values for time series (e.g. what new values are new in the past 90 days).

#### `termsStatsHits`
This result type combines multiple ES aggregations (terms/stats/top_hits) to create a result set.
On top of this the result set also allows for `details` configuration where a summary/details type of results can be achived.

**Configuration:**

```js
config: {
    key_field: '<keyField>',
    value_field: '<valueField>',
    details_key_field: '<detailsKeyField>',       // Optional
    details_value_field: '<detailsValueField>',   // Optional
    size: 500,          // The total result size
    hitSize: 50,        // The hit result size
    details_size: 500,  // The details result size
    order: 'sum',
    sortDir: 'desc',
    include: ['<field1>', '<field2>'],  // // Optional. Which fields to include in the summary.
    details_include: ['<fieldToIncludeInDetails>']  // Optional. Which detail fields to include in the details section
}
```
  **Example:**

```js
{
  key: 'City of Deerfield',
  doc_count: 50,
  count: 6,
  min: 60,
  max: 98,
  avg: 78.5,
  sum: 471,
  hits: [
    {
      Organization: {
        LatLong: '34.056237,-118.257362',
      },
    },
  ],
  details: [
    {
      Organization: {
        ID: '80229',
      },
      doc_count: 1,
      key: 'University Of Michigan at Ann Arbor, MI',
    },
  ],
}
```
}

#### `terms_stats`
#### `twoLevelMatch`
