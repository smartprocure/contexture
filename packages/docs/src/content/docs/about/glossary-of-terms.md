>    connected whole.  
>    1.1. A mass of things interwoven together; a fabric.

### Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

> A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized
> to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a
> general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across
> domains.

### Search Query

According to Wikipedia, `Search Query`, in the context of the `web`, refers to:

> ...a query that a user enters into a web search engine to satisfy his or her
> information needs. Web search queries are distinctive in that they are often
> plain text or hypertext with optional search-directives (such as "and"/"or"
> with "-" to exclude). They vary greatly from standard query languages, which
> are governed by strict syntax rules as command languages with keyword or
> positional parameters.

### Faceted Search

> Faceted search, also known as faceted navigation or faceted browsing, is a
> technique used by eCommerce brands to help users analyze, organize, and
> filter large sets of product inventory based on filters such as size, color,
> price, and brand.

[Source](https://www.dynamicyield.com/glossary/faceted-search/).

> Faceted search, also called faceted navigation or faceted browsing, is a
> technique for accessing information organized according to a faceted
> classification system, allowing users to explore a collection of information
> by applying multiple filters. A faceted classification system classifies each
> information element along multiple explicit dimensions, called facets,
> enabling the classifications to be accessed and ordered in multiple ways
> rather than in a single, pre-determined, taxonomic order.

### Search Filter

> An extension of faceted search, a search filter is a specific product
> attribute a visitor can use to refine the search results of a particular
> category listing, e.g. by size, color, price, or brand. Multiple filters may
> be applied to take a broad range of products and refine them into a more
> narrow selection, allowing the end user to retrieve the most relevant search
> results based on the criteria they’ve selected.

### Configuration Based Development

> The difference between configuration-driven development and model-driven
> development is that the former is not restricted to the model of the code
> such as classes, fields, and relationships. Configuration-driven development
> (CCD) encompasses anything that can be configured within your application.
> For example, if your architecture dictates that particular business rules
> must be applied consistently across your application, you can use
> configuration files to configure and apply those rules.

### Functional Logic Programming

> Functional logic programming is the combination, in a single programming
> language, of the paradigms of functional programming (including higher-order
> programming) and logic programming (nondeterministic programming,
> unification). This style of programming is embodied by various programming
> languages, including Curry and Mercury.
